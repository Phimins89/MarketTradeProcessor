# MarketTradeProcessor
Programming Test

A simple Java web application which uses a websocket endpoint to allow JSON(trade) messages be sent to it. 

This JSON data is then parsed and values are displayed on a line chart which is created from a servlet.

Recommended modifications: 
1. Serialized objects instead of JSON text
2. Display realtime updates for 1000's of trade messages
3. Store trade messages in a database
